# minGPT

This is a copy of https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT, but with a new transformer model type, the transformer with ltm (explained in the paper)
In the experiment.txt file, you can find the results.
If you want to do the same experiment, run the chargpt.py file in the folder of projects. (you have to change which kind of transformer you want to use in the importations part before run the code).
